LEGAL NOTICE
ATTENTION
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) gives notice that the property listed below was seized for
federal forfeiture for violation of federal law. Laws and procedures applicable to the forfeiture process can be found at 19
U.S.C. Sections 1602 - 1619, 18 U.S.C. Section 983, and 28 C.F.R. Parts 8 and 9.
To File a Petition for Remission or Mitigation: The government may consider granting petitions for remission or mitigation,
which pardons all or part of the property from the forfeiture. You may file both a claim and a Petition for Remission or Mitigation
(Petition). If you file only a petition and no one else files a claim, your petition will be decided by the seizing agency and will not
be heard in U.S. District Court. Petitions do not require a cost bond to be submitted and therefore can be filed online. The petition
must include a description of your interest in the property supported by documentation, include any facts you believe justify the
return of the property, and be signed under oath, subject to the penalty of perjury or meet the requirements of an unsworn
statement under penalty of perjury. See 28 U.S.C. Section 1746. For the regulations pertaining to remission or mitigation of the
forfeiture, see 28 C.F.R. Sections 9.1 - 9.9. The criteria for remission of the forfeiture are found at 28 C.F.R. Section 9.5(a). The
criteria for mitigation of the forfeiture are found at 28 C.F.R. Section 9.5(b). The petition need not be made in any particular form
and may be filed online or in writing. You should file a petition not later than 11:59 PM EST 30 days after the date of final
publication of this notice. See 28 C.F.R. Section 9.3(a). The https://www.forfeiture.gov/FilingPetition.htm website provides
access to a standard petition form that may be mailed and the link to file a petition online. If you cannot find the desired assets
online, you must file your petition in writing. This website also provides information on the agency filing address to use when
mailing as well as answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about filing a petition.
To File a Claim: You may contest the forfeiture of the property listed below in U.S. District Court by filing a claim not later than
11:59 PM EST 20 days after the date of final publication of this notice of seizure, unless you received a written notice via
personal letter in which case the deadline set forth in the letter shall apply. A claim must be in writing, describe the seized
property, state your ownership or other interest in the property, and be made under oath, subject to penalty of perjury or meet
the requirements of an unsworn statement under penalty of perjury. See 18 U.S.C. Section 983(a)(2)(C) and 28 U.S.C. Section
1746. The claim of ownership must be accompanied by a cost bond in the amount of $5,000 or ten percent (10%) of the value of
the claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250. If you are unable to post a cost bond, you may request that
ATF waive the cost bond requirement by submitting an In Forma Pauperis Cost Bond Waiver Petition to ATF Forfeiture Counsel.
The cost bond must be in the form of a cashierâ€™s check or money order. No personal checks will be accepted. See 19 U.S.C.
Section 1608. Due to the cost bond requirement, these claims cannot be filed online. A claim need not be made in any particular
form, but a claim form is available at https://www.forfeiture.gov/FilingClaim.htm. See 18 U.S.C. Section 983(a)(2)(D). Claims must
be sent to the ATF pursuant to the instructions shown in this notice.
